##Parody of Belgian energy app 
-----------------------------
This app is a parody on the [Elia 4cast](http://offon.be/nl/ik-zoek-info/de-stroomindicator/met-elia-4cast-heb-je-de-stroomindicator-altijd-bij-de-hand) app.
An app which warns the population of impending blackouts. My parody app warns people of Laurette Onkelinx.
A viscious predator, part of the socialustus subspecies. So far there has only been one Onkelinx spotted in Belgium. 
Local scientist theorize other onkelinxes could be residing in nests under banks, waiting for cracks to appear in the vault floor. Onkelinxes don't hunt in packs, they are lonely creatures. When the ferocious beast sets it eyes on a prey, it goes for the kill by making weird, loud screeches. In rare ocassions, Onkelinxes have been know to co-operate with other species of the socialustus family. A wild Frey'A, a solar energy-sucking creature & a Vandelanus, a seabased beardmonkey, have been know to work together with an Onkelinx. So far there have been no reports of interspecies mating.   

--------------------------------
The real reason I'm making this app is to learn custom transitions.
