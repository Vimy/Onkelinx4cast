##Parody of Belgian energy app 
-----------------------------
This app is a parody on the [Elia 4cast](http://offon.be/nl/ik-zoek-info/de-stroomindicator/met-elia-4cast-heb-je-de-stroomindicator-altijd-bij-de-hand)
An app which warns the population of impending blackouts. My parody app warns people of Laurette Onkelinx.
A viscious creature, part of the PS ecosystem. So far there has only been one Onkelinx spotted in Belgium. 
Local scientist theorize other onkelinx could be residing in nests under banks. 

--------------------------------
The real reason I'm making this app is to learn custom transitions.
